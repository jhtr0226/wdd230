        <p>What is Lorem Ipsum?
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
            industry's standard
            dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
            a type specimen
            book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
            essentially
            unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
            passages, and more
            recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            Why do we use it?
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
            looking at its
            layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
            opposed to using
            'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and
            web page
            editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover
            many web sites
            still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes
            on purpose
            (injected humour and the like).</p>

        <p>Where does it come from?
            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
            Latin literature
            from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College
            in Virginia,
            looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
            the cites of
            the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32
            and 1.10.33
            of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is
            a treatise
            on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
            dolor sit
            amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

            The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
            1.10.32 and
            1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
            accompanied by
            English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

            Where can I get some?
            There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in
            some form,
            by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a
            passage of
            Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the
            Lorem Ipsum
            generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true
            generator on the
            Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence
            structures, to
            generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from
            repetition,
            injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
